Hello! Trying to build a card-game as one of my first large-scale software projects. 

Content will be taken from Avatar the Last Airbender and used as the basis for the game's mechanics.

Project start Dec 25, 2022 (I don't know how to format .md docs)
- Project init, doing some research I'm worried about how to implement this. I need to possibly learn HTML canvas which had not been covered in really any courses. Should be fine!
- If I want to display the final result on my portfolio website, how would that look? I know I need to run a web server but back-end is still an enigma to me.s
