Project start Dec 25, 2022 (I don't know how to format .md docs)
- Project init, doing some research I'm worried about how to implement this. I need to possibly learn HTML canvas which had not been covered in really any courses. Should be fine!
- If I want to display the final result on my portfolio website, how would that look? I know I need to run a web server but back-end is still an enigma to me.

- Made simple dice sprites but need to figure out how to implement dice rolling functionality, build mana system. 
- Switched over to plain JS, figured using a library may be ambitious when I need to develop something using plain JS first! No problem.
GOOD
- Sprites I made are loaded nicely and the rolling works, need to assign actual values to the elements as opposed to merely an image

BAD
- Need to reset the stored elements when rolled, or else the animation plays and the original elements are still there
