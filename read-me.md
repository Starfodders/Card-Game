Hello! Trying to build a card-game as one of my first large-scale software projects.

Project start Dec 25, 2022 (I don't know how to format .md docs)
- Project init, doing some research I'm worried about how to implement this. I need to possibly learn HTML canvas which had not been covered in really any courses. Should be fine!
- If I want to display the final result on my portfolio website, how would that look? I know I need to run a web server but back-end is still an enigma to me.

Dec 26 2022
- Made simple dice sprites but need to figure out how to implement dice rolling functionality, build mana system. 
- I can guess how to do this using plain JS, creating the roller. But how do I add it to Phaser engine?
- Better understanding of NodeJS / ExpressJS, how to properly serve static pages at get
- Create a public dir which can serve images that I need (look into Express JS public dir)
- Loading screens to download all assets that I need (Less relevant, interesting insight moreso!)

Dec 26 amended
- I've already made a 'public' dir, its everything in my webroot folder. 
- Lot of reading ahead of me, need to look at Phaser documentation
- Work on the dice roll, 1 texture with 4 frames (spritesheet)


We're now in the new branch
