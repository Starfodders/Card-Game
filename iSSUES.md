I've created a Card class then extended this class for Attacks and Defenses. What about cards that deal damage and then get defense at same time?
I've placed all the created cards into a single array to loop over to create a deck. Is there an easier way to group them to be looped?

(Fix) - Change class to only Card, have property that has attribute object
