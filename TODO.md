Add buff and debuff files
Example being: Increase or decrease card draw
Power (increased dmg) or Weakness (decreased dmg)

Using Destroy(), reference the card being used and add it to the destroy pile. This will be added back into the deck later and shuffled.

When the deck is initialized, need to set innerHTMl to equal the deck.length

Look into Next.JS to replace Express.JS as it includes bundling.
